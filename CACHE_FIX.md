# FOUND THE ISSUE! üîç

## Problem Identified
The errors show "MCP construction" but your current server name should be "real-whatsapp-mcp". This means Claude Desktop is either:

1. **Reading old cached configuration**
2. **Using an outdated config file**
3. **Has multiple config entries**

## COMPLETE FIX STEPS

### Step 1: Clear Claude Desktop Cache
1. **Quit Claude Desktop completely**
2. Navigate to: `%APPDATA%\Claude`
3. **Delete EVERYTHING** in this folder except `claude_desktop_config.json`
4. This clears all cached MCP data

### Step 2: Create Clean Config
Open `claude_desktop_config.json` and replace with ONLY this:

```json
{
  "mcpServers": {
    "whatsapp": {
      "command": "node",
      "args": ["C:/Users/dhruv/construction-mcp-server/real-whatsapp-server.js"]
    }
  }
}
```

### Step 3: Verify File Path
Make sure the file exists:
```cmd
dir "C:\Users\dhruv\construction-mcp-server\real-whatsapp-server.js"
```

If not found, get your correct path:
```cmd
cd construction-mcp-server
echo %cd%\real-whatsapp-server.js
```

### Step 4: Check for Multiple Config Files
Claude might be reading from multiple locations. Check these:
- `%APPDATA%\Claude\claude_desktop_config.json`
- `%LOCALAPPDATA%\Claude\claude_desktop_config.json`
- `%USERPROFILE%\.claude\claude_desktop_config.json`

**Delete ALL except the one in `%APPDATA%\Claude\`**

### Step 5: Test Simple Server First
Use this minimal config to test:
```json
{
  "mcpServers": {
    "test": {
      "command": "node",
      "args": ["C:/Users/dhruv/construction-mcp-server/simple-whatsapp-server.js"]
    }
  }
}
```

### Step 6: Restart and Verify
1. Restart Claude Desktop
2. Look for server name in Claude interface
3. Should say "test" not "construction"

## Why This Happened
The old server was named "construction-mcp" and Claude cached this. The new server is "real-whatsapp-mcp" but Claude is still reading old data.

Clearing the cache forces Claude to read fresh configuration!
